      "text": "The Great Lakes are undergoing “an ecological catastrophe unlike any this continent has seen,” according to Pulitzer Prize finalist Dan Egan. Humans have dramatically altered the lakes’ fauna since invasive species first snuck up through the man-made Saint Lawrence Seaway. Blunders sometimes stemmed from well-meaning policies. Researchers imported Asian carp to kill river nuisances without chemicals, and now some worry the fish has silently invaded Lake Michigan’s floor via the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. And the lakes’ imported problems are quickly becoming national disasters, such as the tiny and quick-spawning quagga mussel that has infested regions as far away as Lake Mead and Lake Powell on the Colorado River.",

      "text": "The national treasure that is American folk and country music came over on boats from the British Isles in the 17th century, especially the Scots-Irish borderlands. It traveled down the Appalachian – via fiddle, banjo and guitar – in ballads and hymns, the words changing into new songs but the music immutable. For example, it was the first music that the great American songwriter Woody Guthrie ever heard: his mother singing Anglo-Celtic ballads in a high nasal country twang at their home outside Okemah, Oklahoma",

Staff at the HQ of the Metropolitan Police use so much lighting, heating, cooling and electricity that the tower pumps out 13,491 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – equivalent to about 2,200 households. It makes it the most polluting police station in England and Wales and one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gases of any public building in Britain.",

Although fossil records and molecular biology have provided much information on the spread of animal life, scientists have not been able to figure out exactly what sparked this massive diversification. New research shows that nutrient-rich runoff from massive melting glaciers may have provided the extra energy needed to fuel this dramatic evolution.",

      "text": "Bronze Age burials containing pollen from an aromatic plant suggest that floral tribute was an ancient custom in Scotland. Recent excavation of five burial sites has corroborated data from two earlier excavations showing that plants were deposited by people, not by natural processes. The discovery of Filipendula pollen, probably from the plant meadowsweet, has led Scottish archaeologist Richard Tipping to speculate that the plant may have been used in graveside offerings—in bread, as a flavoring in honey or mead, or as a bouquet or floral covering. Meadowsweet is described in herbal literature as having a pleasant scent. Whether it was used in ancient times to raise the spirit of mourners or to counteract the smell of rotten flesh has remained unclear.",

In supporting, in vain, Communist China’s right to take its seat at the UN after the 1949 Revolution, he was admirably clear-sighted and prepared to stand up to the US. But ultimately his passionate advocacy of the US/UN position in the Korean War won him the enmity of the Soviet Union, which refused to take part in UN activities when he was present, forcing him to resign.",

However, that picture faded in the 1960s and 1970s as a breed of anthropologists known as epigraphers cracked the complex hieroglyphic system of Maya writing. The glyphs told a lively story of politics and warfare, and the ceremonial centers became quarrelsome citystates. Now, with a new reading of texts from sites throughout the Maya heartland in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize, the Mayas have taken another step toward modernity. It seems as if most of the individual city-states were tied in two large, durable alliances. Like NATO and the Warsaw Pact, each alliance was led by a dominant power.",

Hip-capitalist entrepreneurs, however, quickly reduced real psy chedelia to a youth-culture style that sold everything from tie-dyed neckties to Volks wagen vans. What came next, in the 70’s, was punk music – and an anarchic graphic sensibility typifi ed by D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself ), a deliberately clumsy hodgepodge of images that were cut and pasted and frequently stolen and photocopied. Punk was known for its ransom-note aesthetic; it broke the tenets of legibility but telegraphed clear-coded mes sages to its audience.",
